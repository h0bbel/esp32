# ESP32 Code

## [ESP-WIFI-RICKROLLER](esp-wifi-rickroller/esp-wifi-rickroller.ino)

Runs a WiFi access point that changes its SSID every 30s. The names are based on the lyrics of "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley.

Anyone connecting to it, will be shown a captive portal.

Based on [esp-wifi-rickroller](https://github.com/marcelstoer/esp-wifi-rickroller) but enhanced with logging and an admin page to view/reset logs.
